**S**pecific — by this we mean that you need to set a specific objective for your programmes.

**M**easurable — your objective should be measurable.

**A**chievable — the objective should be attainable or practicable.

**R**ealistic — which also means credible.

**T**ime-bound — and should be accomplished and achieved within a certain amount of time.

Objectives can be long term or short term.

It may be necessary to achieve some of the short-term objectives before you can achieve the longer-term ones.
